            I&apos;m a full stack developer building mobile and web apps.
            Learning is a passion of mine so I&apos;m always looking forward to
            what&apos;s next. I&apos;m also a podcast and audiobook junkie.

                I worked alongside the amazing team at ChildLine to redesign and
                relaunch their website. The website now features a live chat
                service, booking counseling sessions and much more.

                Additionally, I partnered with ChildLine and UNICEF Eastern
                Caribbean to develop and launch the My ChildLine app on Android
                and iOS. It provides fast access to ChildLine‚Äôs services for
                children in need of support. The app is free and provides quick
                access to ChildLine&apos;s 24/7 Helpline, live chat and
                counselling services. A handful of classic games is also
                available and resources such as emergency services, welfare,
                police and more are also available. A private diary is available
                as well as a mood tracker. Children are also encouraged to learn
                about the UN Convention on the rights of the child right from
                the app. The app also supports the migrant community with
                Spanish and French translations.

                I also partnered with ChildLine to launch their new online
                course platform which allows anyone to take courses from Mental
                Health &amp; Awareness to Laws and Childrens&apos; rights. Each
                short course also provides a certificate on successful
                completion. Learning is part of their digital strategy to
                educate and empower children, young persons and their families
                throughout Trinidad and Tobago to become proactive in the care
                and support of children.
